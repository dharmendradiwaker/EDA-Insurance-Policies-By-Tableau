# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis of Insurance Policies using Tableau

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of **37.5K+ insurance policies** to uncover insights into the trends, behaviors, and patterns of policyholders. The data includes **16 columns**, containing information about the policyholders and the insurance policies they have taken.

Using **Tableau**, I performed data cleaning, exploration, and created a series of **visualizations** to help gain deeper insights into the insurance industry.

## 🧑‍💼 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore the relationships and patterns within the data to provide a better understanding of the insurance policies taken by individuals. By visualizing key variables, we can uncover trends and make informed decisions.

## 📊 Key Steps Taken

### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning** 🧹
   - Loaded the **insurance data** containing **37.5K+ policies** with **16 columns**.
   - Cleaned the data by removing any inconsistencies or missing values to ensure accuracy in the analysis.

### 2. **Data Analysis and Insights** 🔍
   - Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Tableau to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships.
   - Analyzed variables such as policyholder demographics, policy types, and claim history to gain valuable insights.

### 3. **Visualizations Created** 🎨
   - Used various **visualization techniques** in Tableau to present insights clearly and intuitively:
     - **Area Charts**: To show the trends and distribution of policies over time.
     - **Stacked Bar Charts**: To represent multiple categories, such as policy types and regions.
     - **Line Charts**: To analyze trends over periods and compare variables.
   - **Key Findings**:
     - People with **bachelor's degrees** were found to be taking more policies compared to other educational backgrounds.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Education and Policy Ownership** 🎓: 
   - Policyholders with **bachelor’s degrees** tend to take more policies compared to those with other education levels. This could indicate a higher awareness or financial stability among people with higher education.

- **Policy Trends** 📅: 
   - The area charts and line charts highlighted **seasonal trends** in the uptake of insurance policies, helping understand which periods are more favorable for the insurance industry.

- **Demographic Insights** 🏙️:
   - The stacked bar charts revealed trends across different regions, age groups, and genders, giving a deeper understanding of the customer base.
